# Balingo
 Balatro Bingo mod by Milo

This is Balingo! It's Balatro Bingo. Play with a friend by entering the same Bingo seed (you can do the same run seed too, if you want). View your bingo board in Run Info. To win a bingo run, get bingo! *You can restart a bingo run without losing your progress.* If you do, all completed challenges will *remain completed*, but data associated with incomplete challenges (e.g. challenges that have become impossible and progress toward the "Trigger 10 Lucky Cards" challenge) will be reset. To restart a run without losing your progress, create a new game from the in-game menu and check the "Continue Bingo" box. Restarting runs can be a useful strategy to winning the game!

This is the first version I'm releasing publicly! I still want to do more with this project. I haven't been able to playtest it much
yet, I want to add more potential challenges to the board, and I haven't been able to hunt thoroughly for bugs yet. I also will advertise it a bit more when I'm done.

## Installation

Follow the instructions for installing Steamodded <a href="https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki">here.</a> Then copy the full folder of the Github repository into your Balato mods folder. Have fun!
