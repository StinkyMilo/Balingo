# Balingo
 Balatro Bingo mod by Milo

This is Balingo! It's Balatro Bingo. Play with a friend by entering the same Bingo seed (you can do the same run seed too, if you want). View your bingo board in Run Info. To win a bingo run, get bingo! *You can restart a bingo run without losing your progress.* If you do, all completed challenges will *remain completed*, but data associated with incomplete challenges (e.g. challenges that have become impossible and progress toward the "Trigger 10 Lucky Cards" challenge) will be reset. To restart a run without losing your progress, create a new game from the in-game menu and check the "Continue Bingo" box. Restarting runs can be a useful strategy to winning the game!

I still want to add more challenges to this mod (and I likely have some bugs to fix) so stay tuned for updates!
